            You have 60 days from the time we've shipped your order to return any part of it to us
            for a refund, provided it is still in its original, unused condition: we do not accept
            returns of used items.

            No return authorization (RMA) is required. If you are within the United States, a
            pre-paid shipping label will be generated. For direct returns, a flat fee of $10 is
            deducted from your return for shipping and processing costs.

            We ship worldwide via UPS Expedited. We offer flat rate shipping to customers in Canada
            ($30), the EU, Japan, and Singapore ($45â€“$65+), and Australia ($65). Note that most
            brokerage fees are included in the price of UPS Expedited shipping, with the exception
            of a possible $10 fee assessed in Canada only if prior arrangements to pay for duties
            and taxes are not made (see next question and answer).

            Outside of the United States, tariffs, duties, and taxes are the responsibility of the
            customer and are usually paid at time of delivery.
